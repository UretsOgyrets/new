There isn't a direct programming solution to calculate the square of a planet, as planets do not have a numerical value that can be squared. However, you can calculate the square of the distance between two points on a planet's surface or the square of a planet's radius. Here's a Python code example that calculates the square of a planet's radius:

```python
# C Program to Calculate Square of a Number
# Python program to calculate the square of a given number

def calculate_square(number):
    return number * number

# Example usage for calculating the square of a planet's radius
planet_radius = 6371  # Earth's radius in kilometers
square_of_radius = calculate_square(planet_radius)
print(f"The square of the planet's radius is {square_of_radius} km².")
```

This code defines a function called `calculate_square` that takes a number as input and returns its square. In the example usage, the code calculates the square of Earth's radius (6,371 km), which is 40,572,892 km². However, you can replace the `planet_radius` variable with the radius of any planet to calculate its square.
